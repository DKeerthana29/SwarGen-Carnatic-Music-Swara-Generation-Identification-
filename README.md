SwarGen: Carnatic Music Swara Generation and Identification
Overview

SwarGen is an AI-driven system designed for automatic Carnatic music swara generation and identification. The project applies machine learning and pattern recognition techniques to analyze musical patterns and classify swaras. It aims to assist in music analysis, education, and automated music processing.

The system performs two primary tasks:

Swara Identification – Classifying musical input into corresponding swaras.

Swara Generation – Generating swara sequences based on learned musical patterns.

Objectives

Develop a supervised learning model for swara classification.

Extract relevant features from Carnatic music data.

Apply pattern recognition techniques for accurate identification.

Generate swara sequences based on trained model behavior.

Provide a structured AI-based approach to Carnatic music analysis.

Methodology
1. Data Collection

Dataset prepared from labeled Carnatic swara sequences.

Preprocessing applied to remove inconsistencies and normalize input.

2. Feature Extraction

Extracted relevant musical features such as frequency-based and pattern-based attributes.

Converted raw musical input into structured numerical format.

3. Model Training

Applied supervised learning algorithms for classification.

Trained the model on labeled swara data.

Evaluated using performance metrics.

4. Swara Generation

Implemented rule-based and learned pattern-based generation.

Generated new swara sequences based on trained model behavior.
